# Distance Vector Routing

A **distance-vector routing protocol** in data networks determines the best route for data packets based on distance. Distance-vector routing protocols measure the distance by the number of routers a packet has to pass, one router counts as one hop.

This application seeks to mimic the Distance Vector Routing (no concurrency involved for now).
