# Computer Networks

A **distance-vector routing protocol** in data networks determines the best route for data packets based on distance. Distance-vector routing protocols measure the distance by the number of routers a packet has to pass, one router counts as one hop.

***App.py*** seeks to mimic the Distance Vector Routing (no concurrency involved for now).

Run DVR using:

> $ python3 App.py

The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called **subnetting**.

***subnetting.py*** calculates subnet ranges, given a valid IP address.

Run using:

> $ python3 subnetting.py
